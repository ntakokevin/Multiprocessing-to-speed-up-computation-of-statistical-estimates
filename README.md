# Multiprocessing-to-speed-up-computation-of-statistical-estimates
In this exercise, we will utilize multiprocessing to speed-up computation of statistical estimates.

1. Task description. Given a dataset of age, we would ike to estimate standard errors for mean of the age 
and median of the age usinng bootstrap sampling. In bootstrap samping, we draw samples from a dataset with replacement.
2. Please read the description of each function to complete it.

Before runing the code you should extract file age.csv from the file age.rar
